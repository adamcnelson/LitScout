## Clinical Trials

### 1. [LEvetiracetam to Prevent Seizures in Symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease in Adults With Down Syndrome](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07234695)

**NCT ID:** NCT07234695 | **Phase:** Phase 3 | **Status:** RECRUITING

**Conditions:** Down Syndrome, Down Syndrome (DS), Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21), Alzheimer Dementia, Alzheimer Dementia (AD), Alzheimer Disease, Alzheimer Disease (AD), Alzheimer Blood Biomarkers, Epilepsy, Seizures

**Interventions:** Levetiracetam 500mg, Placebo

**Sponsor:** Fundació Institut de Recerca de l'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau | **Collaborators:** Fundación de Investigación Biomédica - Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla, Fundación CITA Alzheimer, University Hospital Virgen de las Nieves

> The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether levetiracetam can prevent epileptic seizures in patients with Alzheimer's disease associated with Down syndrome. It will also analyze whether it can delay the neurodegeneration associated with this disease.

Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group will receive the active drug (levetiracetam), and the other will receive a placebo.

Both groups will receive the treatment for 96 weeks. Each patient will participate for a total of 2 years and 5 months.

### 2. [Tributyrin Treatment in Mild Alzheimer Disease: Assessment of Butyrate Effects Via the Gut-Brain](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06797817)

**NCT ID:** NCT06797817 | **Phase:** Phase 3 | **Status:** NOT_YET_RECRUITING

**Conditions:** Alzheimer Disease (AD)

**Interventions:** tributyrin, Placebo

**Sponsor:** Universidad de Almeria

> The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if tributyrin can help prevent or mitigate cognitive decline in individuals with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The trial will also examine the safety and effects of tributyrin on inflammation and gut microbiota. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does tributyrin reduce inflammation and neurodegeneration markers? How does tributyrin affect gut microbiota and intestinal permeability? Researchers will compare tributyrin to a placebo (a look-alike substance that contains no active ingredient) to evaluate its effectiveness.

Participants will:

### 3. [Study to Assess Safety and Efficacy of PRI-002 in Patients With MCI to Mild Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD)](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06182085)

**NCT ID:** NCT06182085 | **Phase:** Phase 2 | **Status:** ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING

**Conditions:** Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Alzheimer's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Early Onset

**Interventions:** PRI-002, Placebo

**Sponsor:** PRInnovation GmbH | **Collaborators:** Priavoid, Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation - SPRIN-D, Julius Clinical

> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. In the brains of people with AD, certain small substances stick together. This leads to changes in thinking and behaviour. The company PRInnovation is developing a new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, called PRI-002. It is thought that PRI-002 can cut the sticked substances back into small pieces. That would reduce the effects of Alzheimer's disease. In the current study the investigators examine whether PRI-002 is safe and effective in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to AD.
