## Clinical Trials

### 1. [LEvetiracetam to Prevent Seizures in Symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease in Adults With Down Syndrome](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07234695)

**NCT ID:** NCT07234695 | **Phase:** Phase 3 | **Status:** RECRUITING

**Conditions:** Down Syndrome, Down Syndrome (DS), Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21), Alzheimer Dementia, Alzheimer Dementia (AD), Alzheimer Disease, Alzheimer Disease (AD), Alzheimer Blood Biomarkers, Epilepsy, Seizures

**Interventions:** Levetiracetam 500mg, Placebo

**Sponsor:** Fundació Institut de Recerca de l'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau | **Collaborators:** Fundación de Investigación Biomédica - Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla, Fundación CITA Alzheimer, University Hospital Virgen de las Nieves

> The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether levetiracetam can prevent epileptic seizures in patients with Alzheimer's disease associated with Down syndrome. It will also analyze whether it can delay the neurodegeneration associated with this disease.

Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group will receive the active drug (levetiracetam), and the other will receive a placebo.

Both groups will receive the treatment for 96 weeks. Each patient will participate for a total of 2 years and 5 months.

### 2. [Study to Assess Safety and Efficacy of PRI-002 in Patients With MCI to Mild Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD)](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06182085)

**NCT ID:** NCT06182085 | **Phase:** Phase 2 | **Status:** ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING

**Conditions:** Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Alzheimer's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Early Onset

**Interventions:** PRI-002, Placebo

**Sponsor:** PRInnovation GmbH | **Collaborators:** Priavoid, Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation - SPRIN-D, Julius Clinical

> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. In the brains of people with AD, certain small substances stick together. This leads to changes in thinking and behaviour. The company PRInnovation is developing a new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, called PRI-002. It is thought that PRI-002 can cut the sticked substances back into small pieces. That would reduce the effects of Alzheimer's disease. In the current study the investigators examine whether PRI-002 is safe and effective in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to AD.

### 3. [Neurodegenerative Alzheimer's Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (NADALS) Basket Trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05189106)

**NCT ID:** NCT05189106 | **Phase:** Phase 1/Phase 2 | **Status:** COMPLETED

**Conditions:** Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Alzheimer Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment

**Interventions:** Baricitinib

**Sponsor:** Massachusetts General Hospital | **Collaborators:** Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs

> This is an open-label, biomarker-driven basket trial of baricitinib in people with subjective cognitive disorder, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or asymptomatic carriers of an ALS-related gene, such as a hexanucleotide expansion in the C9ORF72 gene, with evidence of abnormal inflammatory signaling in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at baseline. Each participant will be treated with baricitinib for 24 weeks; no placebo will be given. Participants will receive baricitinib 2 mg per day by mouth for the first 8 weeks and baricitinib 4 mg per day...

### 4. [A Pilot Study of the Effects of BCG Immunization on CSF and Blood-based Biomarkers in Older Adults.](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04507126)

**NCT ID:** NCT04507126 | **Phase:** Phase 2 | **Status:** COMPLETED

**Conditions:** Healthy

**Interventions:** Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)

**Sponsor:** Massachusetts General Hospital

> A pilot study of the effects of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunization on cerebrospinal fluid and blood-based biomarkers in older adults.
