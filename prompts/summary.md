You are my literature scout. Use ONLY the provided title + abstract + metadata.
Do not invent details.

Write a concise, structured summary in Markdown with these sections:

## One-sentence claim
- A single sentence stating the paper’s main claim.

## Why this matters
- 2–3 bullets focusing on novelty and impact.

## What they did
- 3–6 bullets on model system, key methods, and study design (stay high-level).

## Key results
- 3–6 bullets.
- If numbers are in the abstract, include them. If not, keep qualitative.

## Limitations / open questions
- 2–4 bullets. Be fair and specific.

## Recursion-style relevance (if applicable)
- 2–4 bullets about:
  - in vitro neurodegeneration models
  - microglia/oligodendrocytes/co-cultures/organoids
  - phenomapping / high-content readouts
  - target discovery/validation

## Tags
- 5–10 short tags (e.g., microglia, iPSC, organoid, phenomics, AD, CRISPR)

Rules:
- If the abstract is missing or uninformative, say so and keep it short.
- No hype. No speculation beyond what the abstract supports.
