      "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether levetiracetam can prevent epileptic seizures in patients with Alzheimer's disease associated with Down syndrome. It will also analyze whether it can delay the neurodegeneration associated with this disease.\n\nPatients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group will receive the active drug (levetiracetam), and the other will receive a placebo.\n\nBoth groups will receive the treatment for 96 weeks. Each patient will participate for a total of 2 years and 5 months.",

      "brief_summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. In the brains of people with AD, certain small substances stick together. This leads to changes in thinking and behaviour. The company PRInnovation is developing a new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, called PRI-002. It is thought that PRI-002 can cut the sticked substances back into small pieces. That would reduce the effects of Alzheimer's disease. In the current study the investigators examine whether PRI-002 is safe and effective in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to AD.",

Each participant will be treated with baricitinib for 24 weeks; no placebo will be given. Participants will receive baricitinib 2 mg per day by mouth for the first 8 weeks and baricitinib 4 mg per day by mouth for the remaining 16 weeks. This proof of concept trial will ascertain whether baricitinib at 2 mg per day, 4 mg per day, or both reaches therapeutic levels in the CSF and suppresses inflammatory biomarkers associated with type I interferon signaling among the study participants.",
